Note: I did not rewrite the code.  Dave Shreiner said in the SIGGRAPH
	University video that the setup tasks such as initializing the shaders
	is the "plumbing" of OpenGL software development.  It is tedious to
	write, but it must be set up for OpenGL to work and it may be reused in
	future programs.  Because many of these commands are required to be
	written verbatem to make the initShaders work, I opted to rewrite the
	comments and summarize the function of the code to demonstrate
	understanding.

- initShaders takes in a pointer to a ShaderInfo struct.  It uses this pointer
    to create a vector of these shaders.  With this vector, the function
    creates and uses a program created from these shaders.
- inputShader reads in and returns the shader file denoted by the inputted
    filename.
- createShader takes the shader (presumably read in from inputShader) and
    compiles the shader.  If the shader fails to compile, a log is printed
    to stderr.  Regardless of whether the compile was successful, the shader
    GLuint is returned.
- createProgram takes in a vector of shaders.  A program is created, shaders
    are attached, and attributes are bound to locations.  The program is
    linked to your actual code (lab2.cpp) and is returned.  If the link fails,
    a log is written to stderr.
- Once shaders have been initialized, the buffer objects and array objects are
    generated and bound.  The verticies are drawn and then the verticies are
    filled with color.  Position and color attributes are distinguished by the
    locations which are bound in createProgram (in this case 0 for position, 1
    for color).
